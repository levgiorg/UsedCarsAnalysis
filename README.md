# Used Car Price Analysis and Prediction

This project analyzes a dataset of 380,000 used car records from various online platforms, aiming to develop a predictive model to suggest price ranges for used cars.

## Introduction

The objective is to provide valuable insights for both buyers and sellers in the used car market.

## Data Preprocessing

The preprocessing stage involves understanding the dataset, identifying irrelevant variables, normalizing data types, and handling missing data.

## Exploratory Data Analysis

This analysis is performed to understand the factors affecting car prices, including brand, age, gearbox type, and fuel type. Key findings include a negative correlation between price and vehicle age/kilometers.

## Advanced Analysis and Predictive Modeling

The project incorporates regression and classification models to analyze vehicle attributes and their relationship with price. Anomaly detection is conducted using the Isolation Forest method.

## Price Range Suggestion

The price range recommender system suggests potential price ranges based on car features, market trends, and comparable listings.

## Temporal Analysis

Temporal patterns in car listings are explored using time series analysis. This includes investigating price fluctuations over time and seasonal trends.

## Usage

Clone the project and run it on a system with Jupyter Notebook installed. The notebook provides detailed explanations through annotations and markdown cells.

## Libraries

The project uses the following Python libraries: NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Sklearn

## Conclusion

The project provides an exhaustive analysis of used car prices, offering valuable insights for market participants.
