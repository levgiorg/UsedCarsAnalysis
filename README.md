# Project Title: Used Car Price Analysis and Prediction

## Introduction:
This project analyses a dataset of 380,000 used car records from various online platforms. It aims to develop a predictive model that suggests price ranges for used cars, providing valuable insights for both buyers and sellers.

## Data Preprocessing:
Data preprocessing involved understanding the dataset, identifying irrelevant variables, normalizing data types, and handling missing data.

## Exploratory Data Analysis:
Exploratory analysis was performed to understand factors affecting car prices, including brand, age, gearbox type, and fuel type. Key findings include a negative correlation between price and vehicle age/kilometers.

## Advanced Analysis and Predictive Modeling:
The project incorporates regression and classification models to analyze vehicle attributes and their relationship with price. Anomaly detection was conducted using the Isolation Forest method.

## Price Range Suggestion:
A price range recommender system was developed. It suggests potential price ranges based on car features, market trends, and comparable listings.

## Temporal Analysis:
Temporal patterns in car listings were explored using time series analysis. Price fluctuations over time and seasonal trends were investigated.

## Conclusion:
This project delivers an exhaustive analysis of used car prices, providing useful insights for market participants.

## Usage:
Clone the project and run it on a system with Jupyter Notebook installed. Annotations and markdown cells within the notebook provide detailed explanations.

## Libraries:
The project uses the following Python libraries: NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Sklearn
